# Cruds in Angular & .net core with Nswag Integration 

The project is majorly a crud project created on angular and .net core 3.1. On the backend side EF(Entity Framework) is used for Database connection and api development.

The major integration in this project is of Nswag, by using Nswag I have auto generate and integrated the apis on the frontend side. Which eventually helped alot in speeding up the development process and increased the code efficiency.


The NSwag project provides tools to generate OpenAPI specifications from existing ASP.NET Web API controllers and client code from these OpenAPI specifications. With NSwag, you don't need an existing APIâ€”you can use third-party APIs that incorporate Swagger and generate a client implementation. NSwag allows you to expedite the development cycle and easily adapt to API changes.
